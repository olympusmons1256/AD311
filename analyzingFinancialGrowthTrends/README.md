# Analyzing Financial Growth Trends
python solution and test framework using unittest to reformat financial data in the following way:
- square input values (as output)
- sort input values in non-descending order (as output)

## Clarifying Questions
- why is the data being squared?
- could all data be negative?
- could array be empty?


## Test Cases

### normal case
- all positive integers
- different array size
- all negative integers 

### edge case
- array with single element
- empty array
- array with matching output integers (i.e. 7,7,5,3,3)

## Space & Time Complexity
- space complexity = o(n)
- time complexity = 0
