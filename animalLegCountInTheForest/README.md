Time Complexity
0(N) 
0(1) #dictionary lookup loops through exactly 1 time based on our logic.

Space Complexity
M = number of unique animals that we store in log_counts
0(M) is a constant space relative to the input.


Clarifying Questions
1. How to handle case?
2. How to handle a list without any animals from the definition? 
3. How to handle large sets of animal definitions?
